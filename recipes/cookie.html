    <p>This sugar cookie frosting is made with confectioners' sugar and shortening instead of butter so it's less likely to melt. It has a lovely vanilla flavor. It's quick and easy to make and works well on both soft and crisp sugar cookies. It starts out soft and spreadable but firms up nicely for cookie stacking and storage.</p>
