    <p>The first recipe I made for my family after my first semester of culinary school was sticky buns. Ever since then, they've had a special place in my heart. It's been my experience with baking that the harder a dough is to work with, the better it comes out and this is no exception — the contrast between this beautifully tender, airy dough and the sweet, crunchy, sticky topping is just otherworldly.</p>
